/**
 * Confirms the exit of a member from a room and optionally bans them.

 * @param {ConfirmExitOptions} options - The options for confirming the exit.
 * @param {Socket} options.socket - The socket instance to emit the event.
 * @param {Socket} [options.localSocket] - The local socket instance to emit the event.
 * @param {string} options.member - The member who is exiting.
 * @param {string} options.roomName - The name of the room the member is exiting from.
 * @param {boolean} [options.ban=false] - Whether to ban the member from the room.
 * @param {boolean} [options.endRoomOnHostExit=true] - Whether a host exit ends the room for everyone.
 * @returns {Promise<void>} A promise that resolves when the exit is confirmed.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const options = {
 *   socket: socketInstance,
 *   localSocket: localSocketInstance,
 *   member: "JohnDoe",
 *   roomName: "Room123",
 *   ban: false,
